/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model with public read access for some collections.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile information. Only the user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /competitions/{competitionId}: Publicly readable competition data.
 * - /teams/{teamId}: Publicly readable team data.
 * - /matches/{matchId}: Publicly readable match data.
 * - /news/{newsId}: Publicly readable news articles.
 * - /admins/{adminId}: Admin user data. Only admins can read/write.
 * - /users/{userId}/favorites/data: User's favorite teams and competitions. Only the user can read/write their own favorites.
 * - /predictions/{fixtureId}: Matches pinned by admins for user prediction; publicly readable.
 * - /predictions/{fixtureId}/userPredictions/{userId}: Individual user predictions for a match. Only the user can read/write their own predictions.
 * - /leaderboard/{userId}: Aggregated prediction scores for each user. Publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access is granted to /competitions, /teams, /matches, /news, and /predictions.
 * - Users can only access their own data under the /users/{userId} collection.
 * - Predictions are stored under /predictions/{fixtureId}/userPredictions/{userId} and only accessible by the user making the prediction.
 * - Admin access is not currently enforced in this simplified ruleset, but the structure allows for it.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The current rules do not require denormalization. If access control becomes more complex (e.g., shared access to predictions), consider denormalizing access control data (e.g., list of authorized user IDs) onto the relevant documents.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - The rules leverage subcollections (e.g., /users/{userId}/favorites/data) to segregate user-specific private data.
